## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a Google Gemini API key. You can get one for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ayushsa24/ChatBot].git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd [ChatBot]
    ```

3.  **Create a `config.js` file:**
    In the main project folder, create a new file named `config.js`. This file will hold your secret API key.

4.  **Add your API key to `config.js`:**
    Open `config.js` and add the following line, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
    ```
    **Important:** This file should *not* be committed to a public Git repository. Add `config.js` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally sharing your secret key.

5.  **Link the config file in `index.html`:**
    Open your `index.html` file and add the following script tag inside the `<head>` section, **before** your main script file (`script.js` or `main.js`).
    ```html
    <head>
      <script src="config.js"></script>
      <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    ```

### Running the Application

Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). That's it!

## Usage

1.  **Ask a Text Question:**
    -   Type your question into the input box at the bottom.
    -   Press Enter or click the send button.
    -   Wait for the intelligent response from the Gemini API.

2.  **Ask about an Image:**
    -   Click the attachment (üìé) or image icon.
    -   Select an image file from your device (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, etc.).
    -   Once the image preview appears, type your question related to the image (e.g., "What is in this picture?", "Describe this scene.", "What color is the car?").
    -   Press Enter or click the send button to get a vision-based answer.
